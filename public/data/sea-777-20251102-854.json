Airworthiness directives (ADs) has been issued requiring inspections and\r\nreplacement of seat adjustment components. The AD is comprised of two Service Bulletins (SBs). For\r\nthe Horizontal Movement System Inspection and Overhaul, United will comply by removing any of the\r\naffected seats from the aircraft and replacing with a serviceable seat from stock. For the Manual\r\nOverride Cable Inspection and Adjustment, United will comply by inspecting and adjusting per the Ipeco\r\nSBs. In order to ensure unmodified seats are not installed on any aircraft, all spare seats will be modified\r\nprior to incorporation of this EA.",
